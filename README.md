## Introduction

This is an example setup for Jekyll for a website that has existing html pages.

Using Jekyll would have the benefit of reducing duplication, using scss and a bunch of other things while not having to immediately rewrite an existing webpage.

Here is an 'existing website':

```
    site/
        existing-page.html
        .....
```

## Setup

### MacOS instructions

```
 gem install bundler jekyll                   ## Use sudo if that fails
 bundle exec jekyll serve
```

See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ for more instructions.

## Directory Structure

Ideally, all existing pages would be refactored to use layouts and includes. But I was curious about how easy it would be to chuck in existing pages into the mix.

```
    site                              ## This is the website that is generated by jekyll and is deployed to your server
    _config.yml                       ## Config for the website
    Gemfile
    Gemfile.lock
    src/
        assets/
            styles/
                main.scss               ## This will get converted to css by jekyll
        _includes
        _layouts/                       ## reusable page templates (pages that include all metadata, header, footer, etc)
            default.html
        existing-page                   ## This is an existing legacy page that I did not want to update
        pages/                          ## All new pages go in this folder
            index.html
            about.html
            existings_pages/            ## These are pages with a permalink added to the top - but not modified in any other way
                other-existing-page.html
        404.html
```
